# Project Portfolio: Woowprint

Welcome to my portfolio project repository! This is a work of mine that I've done on the Woowprint project as a freelancer.

# Project Overview

WOOWPRINT is the name of a company that offers custom sticker making and acrylic manufacturing services. In addition, Woowprint also provides photo printing services which are the background for making this application. 

This Woowprint application is an order management system for photo printing. So that every customer who wants to print photos can upload photos into this system without having to sacrifice photo quality at all, besides that every order that comes in and is managed through this application, customers can monitor every progress through the order tracking feature. 

The main idea of this application workflow is when Admin receive new order on Whatsapp or other platform they will create a new order ticket and pass the order number to the customer that will allow the customer to upload their photos. After the customer confirm that they are done uploading the order will be queued to the printing progress and will be continue the progress until shipped to the customer address.

In this project, I was responsible for creating the development plan and develop the web application using PHP programming language and CodeIgniter 4 as the main back-end programming stack and also using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jquery and some other js library to build it's front-end.

- The challenge is how should I be able to design this application only with the initial idea from the client's explanation which is a bit unclear, actually the client gives me an example of a similar program but I can only see the UI from the outside because I don't have admin privileges to enter the application
